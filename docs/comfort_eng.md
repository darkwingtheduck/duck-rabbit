 # The Comfort Bear and the Kind Country

![keep calm](tryggbjorn.png)


In a small country far to the north, people had worked hard for many years.
They had built bridges that held through winter, and houses where the old could sit warm.
They had schools where children were given food every day.
Not fancy food, but enough.

They were proud of that.

When the country was finally working rather well, one of its leaders said:

“We have done well.
Now we must become even kinder.
Open your hearts.”

And so they created the Comfort Bear.

It was large, soft, and calm to look at.
It was not meant to say no
or make demands.
It was meant to comfort, to soothe,
and to make things feel all right.

The Comfort Bear quickly became a symbol of the country.
It appeared on posters, in classrooms, and in storybooks.
Adults said to children:

“This is what goodness looks like.
No harsh words.
No demands.”

When something went wrong, the Comfort Bear said:

“It’s all right.”

When someone did wrong, it said:

“We must understand.”

And when someone said stop,
the Comfort Bear said:

“We don’t speak like that here.”

Over time, the language of the country began to change.

No one hit anyone anymore.
There were only mis-pushings.

No one took anything.
Situations arose.

No one was responsible.
Things just happened.

At the edge of the town square stood an old donkey.
His name was Eeyore.
He did not say much.
But when he did say something,
it was usually true.

When people talked about comfort,
Eeyore said:

“It looks comfortable.
But someone will slip.”

No one became angry.
People smiled a little.

“That’s just how he is,” they said.
“One shouldn’t listen too much.”

Marta noticed how people changed
when the Comfort Bear spoke.

How they nodded before thinking it through.
How their eyes softened
and their thoughts grew short.

It was as if goodness settled
like a blanket over the room.

She also noticed
that Eeyore never nodded.

One day she asked him:

“Why don’t you nod?”

“Because none of that
stops anything,” said Eeyore.
“It only sounds nice.”

Marta stood quietly for a moment.
Then she said:

“I think you’re right.”

When Marta’s little brother was pushed at school
and dropped his lunch box into the snow,
the Comfort Bear said:

“That was a mis-pushing.”

“Who pushed him?” Marta asked.

The Comfort Bear smiled kindly.

“We don’t point,” it said.
“We work with comfort.”

Everyone nodded.
Marta saw the relief.
It was pleasant not to have to know.

“That will happen again,”
said Eeyore calmly.

“Yes,” said Marta.
“If no one says stop.”

The adults heard only one of the voices.

So signs were put up:

STOP MIS-PUSHINGS

They did not say who was meant to stop.

The leader spoke again:

“We must open our hearts even more.”

Marta noticed that some hearts
were always expected to be open.
And that others never had to be.

Soon the Comfort Bear began to speak more about sharing.

“We have so much,” it said.
“And in the great forest around our country
there are animals who have nothing at all.”

So people began to feed the animals of the forest.
Bread for the birds.
Soup for the deer.
Apples for any creature that came close.

It felt very kind.

When someone asked where the food came from,
the Comfort Bear said:

“We are redistributing.”

At first it was barely noticeable.
A little less on the plates at school.
A little thinner soup at the care home.

“That won’t be enough,” said Eeyore.
“Someone will go hungry.”

“The children,” said Marta.
Not as a question.

Eeyore nodded.
For the first time.

When Marta asked why her grandmother
no longer received a hot meal every day,
the Comfort Bear said:

“We must look at the whole picture.”

Everyone nodded again.
It was easier than counting.

In Marta’s mind, the Comfort Bear
acquired another name.

She did not call it a bear anymore.
Not even to herself.

She called it
the moral super-bear.

Because it was always right.
And it never had to see
who was pushed
or who was hungry.

One evening her little brother said:

“If I’m hungry,
is that comfort too?”

Then Marta understood.

She understood that the Comfort Bear
had not taken power.

It had been given it.

No one had been forced.
No one had been threatened.

Everyone had simply nodded.
Once more.
Because it was easier
than saying no
and standing still.

The next day, the Comfort Bear stood in the square
beside the leader.

“Open your hearts,” he said.

Everyone nodded.

Eeyore stood beside Marta.
He said nothing.

“Say it again,” Marta whispered.
“So I can say it out loud.”

“The children pay,” said Eeyore.
“So others can feel good.”

Marta stepped forward.

She was not angry.
She did not shout.

She said:

“The children are hungry.
The old are cold.
The animals are full.
And no one is allowed to say stop.”

There was complete silence.

Not an angry silence.
But the kind
that comes
when hypnosis breaks.

“You can’t say it like that,”
someone whispered.

But a few people stopped nodding.

The Comfort Bear looked smaller after that.
Not broken.
Just no longer unquestioned.

And the country slowly remembered
something it had forgotten:

That comfort without boundaries
protects no one.

**Final Words**

Marta learned something
that no adult had said aloud.

That a sure sign something is very wrong
is when the moral super-bear closes its eyes
to violations of the Golden Rule.

When it says that everyone is equal,
but allows some to be pushed
and others to carry the consequences.

For every time the super-bear looks away,
someone else pays the price.

And that is why all children,
and perhaps a few adults too,
should ask themselves a simple question:

Who pays the price
for the bear’s blindness
and its silence?
